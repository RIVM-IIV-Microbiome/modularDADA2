# ModularDADA2  

Converting the dada2 big data workflow into a modular pipeline for analysing multiple sequencing libraries.  

Divided into 

  * Preprocessing  
  * Infer Sequence Variants and remove chimera  
  * Taxonomic assignments

## Codes  
This is accomplished by set of three functions.  

  * Preprocessing  
      * 01_preprocessing.R  
      
  * Infer Sequence Variants and remove chimera   
      * 02_inferSequenceVariantsBD.R  
      
  * Taxonomic assignments   
      * 03_taxonomyAssignments.R
